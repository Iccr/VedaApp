# Veda Ios modules generators
###### There are many times when we write same thing in different app. Like qr scanner, search etc. This is an attempt to automate the redundant task. Using command line we can generate specific task without writing all the codes. All codes generated can be customized according to your needs and are well tested. currently All codes are generated for Swift.
