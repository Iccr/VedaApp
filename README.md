###### There are many times when we write same thing in different app. Like qr scanner,create models from api.. etc. This is an attempt to automate the redundant task. Using command line we can generate specific task without writing all the codes. All codes generated can be customized according to your needs and are well tested. currently All codes are generated for Swift.


#### It is a collection of the common tools that we write over and over. And can create them with one line of code. 


examples: 

```veda generate qr -f path_to_view_controller```

```veda generate model input.json```

```veda generate webview -f path_to_view_controller```
